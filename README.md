--What to Download--
Downloading the autoclicker.exe file will allow you to run the app. Alternatively, you can download the autoclicker.py and the mouseicon.png file and run the app like you would another python program.

--How to Use--
The 'Add New' button allows you to add a new autoclicker/macro. You can select which to add by using the 'Type' selector.
The 'Active' checkbox indicates whether an autoclicker/macro will be active when the mode is set to running.
The 'Name' textbox lets you name your autoclicker/macro.
The 'Delete' button removes the corrsponding autoclicker/macro.
The 'Toggle Key' textbox allows you to set the key which turns the autoclicker/macro on/off. Typing a key into it will then display the key you typed in the textbox.
Macros have an additional 'Loop' checkbox that indicates whether they will loop back to their first command after completing all of their commands.
The 'Click Key' selector lets you choose whether to have the mouse or a keyboard key click.
  If you choose 'Mouse' another selector appears to let you choose which mouse button will be clicked.
  If you choose 'Keyboard' another textbox similar to the 'Toggle Key' textbox appears allowing you to set the keyboard key to by clicked.
The 'Delay' textbox lets you set the delay in milliseconds between clicks for autoclickers. For macros, it sets the time to wait until executing the next command.
Macros have an additional 'Add Another Command' button that allows you to add another command for the macro to execute.

Once you have set up your autoclickers/macros, you can click the 'Change mode to Running' button at the top to disable editing and start executing autoclickers/macros.
When the set toggle key is pressed, the corrsponding autoclicker/macro will turn on/off.
You can click the 'Change mode to Edit' button at the top to disable all active autoclickers/macros and begin editing.

--Known Issues--
Having a Click Key be !,@,#,etc. will output 1,2,3,etc. instead of the proper symbol.
Some combos of keys like fn+f1 do not works as valid keys in Toggle Key and Click Key textboxes.
There is no support for uppercase click key output or toggle keys.
Adding many autoclickers/macros will move ones closer to the bottom off screen, rendering them inacessible and uneditable.

--Possible Future Improvements--
Delete button for individual commands
Ability to set number of times a command executes
Ability to set how long a click is held
Ability to save the current configuration to a file.
Ability to load a previous configuration from a file.
