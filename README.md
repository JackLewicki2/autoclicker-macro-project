--What to Download--<br/>
Downloading the autoclicker.exe file will allow you to run the app. Alternatively, you can download autoclicker.py and run the app like you would any other python program.<br/>
<br/>
--Setting Up Autoclickers/Macros--<br/>
The 'Add New' button allows you to add a new autoclicker/macro. You can select which to add by using the 'Type' selector.<br/>
The 'Active' checkbox indicates whether an autoclicker/macro will be active when the mode is changed to running.<br/>
The 'Name' textbox lets you name your autoclicker/macro.<br/>
The 'Delete' button removes the corrsponding autoclicker/macro.<br/>
The 'Toggle Key' textbox allows you to set the key which turns the autoclicker/macro on/off. Typing a key into it will then display the key you typed in the textbox.<br/>
The 'Click Key' selector lets you choose whether to have the mouse or the keyboard click a key.<br/>
&ensp;  If you choose 'Mouse' another selector appears to let you choose which mouse button will be clicked.<br/>
&ensp;  If you choose 'Keyboard' a textbox similar to the 'Toggle Key' textbox appears allowing you to set the keyboard key to by clicked.<br/>
--Autoclicker Specific--<br/>
The 'Delay' textbox lets you set the delay in milliseconds between clicks.<br/>
--Macro Specific--<br/>
The 'Loop' checkbox indicates whether the macro will loop back to its first command after completing all of its commands.<br/>
The 'Add Another Command' button allows you to add another command for the macro to execute.<br/>
You can delete a macro command by clicking the 'Delete Command' button on the very right of the command you wish to delete.<br/>
The 'Hold For' textbox sets the time the selected key should be held down in milliseconds.<br/>
The 'Run' textbox sets the number of times that a command will run before moving onto the next command.<br/>
The 'Delay' textbox sets the time to wait in milliseconds after each iteration of a command.<br/>
The 'Click Key' selector has an addition field 'Wait' in which no key will be clicked. The total time waited for equals (Times Run) * (HoldFor + Delay). <br/>
<br/>
--Running the Autoclickers/Macros--
Once you have set up your autoclickers/macros, you can click the 'Change mode to Running' button at the top to disable editing and start executing the autoclickers/macros.<br/>
When you press the assigned Toggle Key, the corrsponding autoclicker/macro will turn on/off.<br/>
You can click the 'Change mode to Edit' button at the top to disable all active autoclickers/macros and begin editing.<br/>
<br/>
--Saving/Loading--<br/>
Clicking the 'Save File' button at the bottom allows you to save your current autoclickers/macros to a file.<br/>
Clicking the 'Load File' button at the bottom allows you to load previously saved autoclickers/macros. The autoclickers/macros in the file will be added to the bottom of any you currently have in the application. <br/>
<br/>
--Miscellaneous--<br/>
There is a scrollbar located on the right side of the window. You can use it to scroll through the application if the size of the autoclickers/macros exceeds the window size.<br/>
In an emergency, you can change the mode to Edit by clicking the "CapsLock" key three times. It works best if you spam click "CapsLock" because the inputs can be dropped sometimes depending on what autoclickers/macros you are executing.<br/>
Please do not include the string '\_$$$\_' in the name textbox because then the autoclicker/macro will not save properly.<br/>
An autoclicker/macro will not execute if any of its textboxes are empty (except for the name, which is not necessary).<br/>
<br/>
--Known Issues--<br/>
None right now.<br/>
<br/>
--Possible Future Improvements--<br/>
Ability to move the mouse to a certain location or by a certain amount.<br/>
Have a macro command that types a string of text instead of individual characters. <br/>
